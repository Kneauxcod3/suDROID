Linux (Bash) Script: suDROID.sh

The Bash script automates the rooting process for Linux users, using common Linux package managers to install dependencies, check device connectivity, retrieve and patch the boot image, and flash it back onto the device.

Windows (PowerShell) Script: suDROID.ps1

The PowerShell script provides a smooth rooting experience for Windows users by utilizing native commands for dependency management, file handling, and boot image patching with Magisk.
