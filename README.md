# suDROID
	This script provides a convenient and automated way to patch the boot image of an Android device, saving your time and effort compared to manually patching the image.

sudroid.sh for any Linux distribution 
sudroid.bat for any Windows version

THIS SCRIPT WILL USE "Magisk"

	The script performs the following steps:

• It checks if the required tools, such as adb and fastboot, are installed on the system. If any tool is missing, the script prompts the user to install it.
• The script prompts the user to connect the Android device to the computer via USB and ensure that USB debugging is enabled on the device.
• The script then reboots the device into bootloader mode using adb.
• It extracts the boot image from the device using adb.
• The script applies a set of patches to the boot image using the patch tool. These patches include disabling dm-verity, disabling forced encryption, and enabling insecure adb.
• The patched boot image is then flashed back to the device using fastboot.
• The device is then rebooted into the system, and the script terminates.

	HOW TO USE

1. Open a terminal window in Linux.
2. Download (git clone) this repo
3. Navigate to the repo directory
4. Plug your Android device via USB cable
5. Take a cup of coffee, tee maybe beer or wine (why not)
6. Run the script as sudo/administrator (sudo ./sudroid.sh) (run as asdimistrator sudroid.bat)
7. Relax until you get the Done! message.
8. Unplug your Android device
9. Enjoy

	p.s. if there is any problem while running just remove the banner part ;)
